Purple Web Framework
====

Yet another web framework that tries to be lightweight and simple. It is meant to be capable to control multiple databases using different drivers.

Sadly, I didn't have time to create any usable docs, just some inlined javadoc style comments.

Why purple?

It's the color of undead scourge and also my favourite. Original name was YaWF as for "Yet another Web Framework", but that was taken.
