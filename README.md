# Purple Web Framework

Yet another web framework that tries to be lightweight and simple. It is meant to be capable to control multiple databases using different drivers.

Sadly, I didn't have time to create any usable docs, just some inlined javadoc style comments.


## Installation

1. Unpack the friendly package
2. Ensure, that the following directories and all files included are writable for web server
	- etc
	- var
3. Setup vhost or path and call the right url in browser
4. You should see pwf setup which will help you configure basic settings
5. Run 'bin/db init'
6. Now you're ready to go .. you know .. when I finish the docs.


## Why purple?

It's the color of undead scourge and also my favourite. Original name was YaWF as for "Yet another Web Framework", but that was taken.
