INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
First, check read and write permissions of the future root folder.

If you're not tough enough, go to http://yacms.scourge.cz/ and download 
latest installer. Then just follow instructions and click your way trough. 
Simple installation does not take more than five minutes.

If you feel for it, you may install YaCMS manually. There are steps you need 
to do:

 1. Unpack the package archive. You've already done that if you're reading this
 2. Create directory 'var' in packages' root and set up writeable 
    permissions for server, so that YaCMS can write into it
 3. Create environment in etc/conf.d
 4. Copy config files from etc/default.d/{env}/
 5. Config your database access. etc/conf.d/{env}/database.json
 6. Run `bin/db init --verbose` from your document root
 7. Set writeable permissions in etc/conf.d
 8. You should be able now to login at http://{yourserver}/god. Default user 
    is root:poklop
 9. Contribute by your ideas and opinions on http://yacms.scourge.cz

It is possible I'll make a way to do these steps from your shell. Someday.
